## 3 Features to implement

- Register and User Login :

  It is the fundamental feature since every user must register and login to use the app, otherwise it wonâ€™t provide any service. Although the private information leakage may occur some time, it becomes easier for us to offer a customized  application for users. 

- User information update :

  It looks like a auxiliary feature for the former one. As we all know, we cannot change our WeChat ID, but users can feel at ease changing their name in our application. For safety, users are allowed to change their password to prevent being stolen.

- Encyclopedia for animation characters : 

  Our application is aimed for animation enthusiasts. Information about these animation characters is one of the most important feature which is to broaden user's knowledge base of animation. In another way, all other recognition part relies on the encyclopedia.

## Test Scenario

- Register and User Login :

  For **login**, when user logins successfully to his account, he will go into the main page, including recognition, wiki, community, personal information. Else, if user fails in filling the e-mail, a red **Enter Valid email** dialog box will be shown. If user fails in filling password, a red **Network Error** dialog box will be shown. If network cannot link, a **Wrong email or password** dialog box will be shown. For **register**, when user register, it is almost the same as **login**. Besides, when the **password** and the **confirm pasword** do not match, a **password Does Not Matches** dialog box will be shown. If user registers successfully, it will return to the main page.

- User information update :

  As I have mentioned above, **login** and **register** are similar. **update** is also nearly the same as **register**. Besides, when user updates successfully, a **Update succeeds** dialog box will be shown.

- Encyclopedia for animation characters : 

  If the user visits the server successfully, it will show some animation characters with their name. If the server cannot be touched, a **Network error** dialog box will be shown.
