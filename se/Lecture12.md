**Abstraction**

- Procedural abstraction

  - Naming a sequence of instructions

  - Parameterizing a procedure

- Data abstraction

  - Naming a collection of data

  - Data type defined by a set of procedures

- Control abstraction

  - W/o specifying all register/binary-level steps
- Performance abstraction O(N)



**Modularity**

**Minimizing coupling, maximizing cohesion**

Developers should moving functionality from one module to another, this will

- Decrease coupling between modules
- Increase cohesion in one module
- Decrease cohesion in another



**Enhancing reliability**

- Name generalization (names modified to use domain independent language)
- Operation generalization (operations added to provide extra functionality, domain specific operations may be removed)
- Exception generalization (application specific exceptions removed, exception management added to increase robustness)
- Component Certification (component warranted correct and reliable for reuse)



**Component Composition Infrastructure Elements**

- Data exchange model

- Automation
- Structured storage
- Underlying object model
