eXtreme Programming(XP)



**Traditional WATERFALL PROCESS ACTIVITIES**

- Requirements – what software should do 

- Design – structure code into modules; architecture 

- Implementation – hack code 

- Integration – put modules together 

- Testing – check if code works 

- Maintenance – keep making changes



**EXTREME PROGRAMMING XP**

Main ideas:

- Don’t write much documentation 

  - Working code and tests are the main written product
- Implement features one by one 
- Release code frequently 
- Work closely with the customer 
- Communicate a lot with team members

Some key practices:

- Planning game for requirements 
- Test-driven development for design and testing 
- Refactoring for design 
- Pair programming for development 
- Continuous integration for integration



**PAIR PROGRAMMING**

- Driver: types or writes 

- Navigator: observer (looking for tactical & strategic defects) 
- Periodically switch roles of driver and navigator
- Pair coding, design, debugging, testing, etc.



**XP IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS**

- Iteration = two week cycle (1-3 weeks) 
- Plan each iteration in an iteration meeting that is held at the start of the iteration 
- Iteration is going to implement set of user stories 
- Divide work into tasks small enough to finish in a day 
- Each day, programmers work in pairs to finish tasks



A **user story** represents a **feature**.

- A user story is the smallest amount of information (a step) necessary to allow the customer to define (and steer) a path through the system

- written by customers (not developers)



**FORMAT OF A USER STORY**

- Title: 2-3 words 
- Acceptance test (unique identifier) 
- Priority: 1-2-3 (1 most important) 
- Story points (can mean #days of ideal development time, i.e., no distractions or working on other things) 
- Description: 1-2 sentences (a single step towards achieving the goal)

**Story point**:  

unit of measure for expressing the overall size of a user story, feature, or other piece of work.  The raw value of a story point is unimportant.  What matters are the relative values.
