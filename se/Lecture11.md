**Defensive programming** (Error Avoidance)

is a form of defensive design intended to ensure the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances. 



**Defensive Programming Examples**

• Use boolean variable not integer
• Test i <= n not i = = n
• Assertion checking (e.g., validate parameters)
• Build debugging code into program with a switch to display values at interfaces
• Error checking codes in data (e.g., checksum or hash)



**Security in the Software Development Process**

- Barriers
- Authentication & Authorization
- Encryption



**Component-Based Software Engineering**

- CBSE is an approach to software development that relies on reuse



**Commercial Off-the-Shelf Software**

- COTS systems are usually complete applications library the off an applications programming interface (API)



**Domain analysis**

- define application domain to be investigated
